# Task 01 - Use GitHub Copilot to create an Issue

## Introduction

Zava has upgraded the Zava Storefront from .NET 6 to .NET 8 LTS. This exercise demonstrates how Copilot can be used to create issues and automate code updates. You can explore this by creating a similar issue for other improvements.

This lab demonstrates creating an issue to perform updates on the solution, and then assigning it to Copilot to complete the implementation based on the issue. 

## Description

In this task you will learn how to create a new issue using GitHub Copilot. The solution has already been upgraded to .NET 8 LTS, but you can practice creating issues for other improvements.

## Success Criteria

- You have created a new issue using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.
